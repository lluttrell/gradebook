I have some pathnames hard-coded here, so to build the project:

1) su into richard.williams2
2) use make -f mochaMake to build the project.

Assuming nothing has been screwed up in /freeforall/ you can run the program
  using the command:

   /freeforall/richard.williams2/gradebook

If you would like to enable the professor part of the program, you just need 
to change the group of the program and the group of the studentgrade directory

eg:

   chgrp /freeforall/richard.williams2/gradebook <groupname>
   chgrp /freeforall/richard.williams2/studentgrades <groupname>

Then any members of <groupname> are "professors" (actually literally are/will
be in this case).

This is not neccesary for the sploit though as you can see in my video.

help.txt is a fake manpage that shows the instructions. It can also be read
using the -f option when running the program.

The bare minimum for the sploit to work will be to initialize the victims
gradebook. From richard.williams2 just run

    /freeforall/richard.williams2/gradebook -i -u <victim username>
